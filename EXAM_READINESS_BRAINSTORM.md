# Exam Readiness Assessment: "Am I Ready?" Feature Brainstorm

## Overview
Transform the Progress page into a comprehensive exam readiness dashboard that answers the critical question: **"Am I ready to take the real PMP exam?"**

## Core Readiness Score (0-100%)

### Primary Readiness Indicator
A single, prominent readiness score that combines multiple factors:

**Formula Components:**
1. **Overall Accuracy** (30% weight)
   - Current accuracy across all practice questions
   - Target: ≥75% for readiness
   - Recent trend (improving/declining)

2. **Knowledge Area Coverage** (25% weight)
   - Percentage of knowledge areas with ≥70% accuracy
   - All 10 knowledge areas should be covered
   - No knowledge area below 50% accuracy

3. **Mock Exam Performance** (25% weight)
   - Average score on full-length mock exams (180 questions)
   - Number of completed mock exams (minimum 2-3 recommended)
   - Consistency across multiple attempts
   - Target: ≥75% average score

4. **Question Volume** (10% weight)
   - Total questions answered (minimum 500+ recommended)
   - Coverage across all knowledge areas
   - Variety of difficulty levels attempted

5. **Recent Performance Trend** (10% weight)
   - Performance over last 7/14/30 days
   - Improving trend = positive indicator
   - Declining trend = warning sign

### Readiness Categories
- **🟢 Ready (80-100%)**: Strong performance across all metrics, ready to schedule exam
- **🟡 Almost Ready (60-79%)**: Good progress, minor gaps to address
- **🟠 Needs More Practice (40-59%)**: Significant gaps, continue studying
- **🔴 Not Ready (<40%)**: Early stage, focus on fundamentals
