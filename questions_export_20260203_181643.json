The main output from this process is the communications management plan. The project charter, stakeholder register, enterprise environmental factors, organizational process assets, and project management plan (among others) are all inputs to this process. The project charter is a document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that formally authorizes the existence of a project. The charter identifies the key project stakeholders. Note that the stakeholder register contains a more comprehensive list of stakeholders that would include the key stakeholders; however, since the answer choice specifies 'key' stakeholders, the project charter is a better answer choice. The stakeholder register is a project document that includes the identification, assessment, and classification of project stakeholders. This information can be used to help plan communication activities that would be appropriate for these stakeholders. Enterprise environmental factors are conditions, not under the immediate control of the project team, that influence, constrain, or direct the project. The geographic distribution of facilities and resources are among the enterprise environmental factors that may impact how communications will be planned and managed. For example, the location of human resources may necessitate the need for virtual communication tools. Organizational process assets are plans, processes, policies, procedures, and knowledge bases that are specific to and used by the performing organization. The organization's policies and procedures will provide boundaries for the acceptable use of social media, which may need to be incorporated into the communications management plan.

The PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition, in the Project Work Performance Domain (Section 2.5.4), explains that effective communication requires sharing information and confirming it is understood, which can only be achieved by tailoring communication to individual needs.

One of the ceremonies associated with scrum is the daily standup meeting (also known as the daily scrum).

This is a common misconception. Original BAC is the cost baseline (the overall project budget, excluding the management reserve). When the overall actual costs at the project completion are higher than the original BAC, then the project is indeed considered over budget. However, as the project progresses, costs are continuously monitored. When at any point throughout the project's life cycle it becomes evident that the project cannot be completed within the originally planned BAC, a new estimation is determined and, once approved, becomes the new \"budget at completion\". However, to avoid confusion, it's no longer called BAC. It's called estimate at completion, EAC.

After analyzing the best way to define and manage requirements, develop deliverables, handle changes, control risk and cost, and engage key stakeholders, the decision is made to select a hybrid life cycle.", "explanation" : "Predictive and agile project life cycles differ from one another in several aspects. One of them is the way cost and risk are controlled. Predictive projects develop detailed plans up-front, including the cost baseline and risk responses. The risk responses are planned with the allocated contingency reserves that are part of the cost baseline. Then, as the project progresses, the actual costs are compared to the cost baseline, and variances, if found, are controlled using dedicated tools and techniques. Agile projects, on the other hand, adapt almost in real-time as new requirements and constraints emerge. The most typical way for an agile project to control cost and risk is to update the product backlog with the new information and re-prioritize the backlog based on the highest value for the customer, thus resulting in a risk-adjusted backlog.

As the iteration retrospective approaches, the scrum master requests that the team prepares all the data required to calculate the various earned value metrics.", "explanation" : "Earned value management (EVM) is typically associated with the predictive (traditional) project management approaches. However, applying EVM metrics to projects carried out using agile methods can be done similarly and serve as an effective tool to measure team performance. For example, the schedule performance index (SPI) is the number of story points (features) completed divided by the number of story points (features) planned. The cost performance index (CPI) is the earned value (EV, which is the value of the completed story points or features) divided by the actual costs incurred during the period under measurement. The interpretation of the SPI and CPI values in agile projects is similar to the interpretation of those values in traditional projects. For example, an SPI less than 1.0 means the project (or iteration) is behind schedule, or, in other words, the team is working at a rate lower than planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 means the project (iteration) is ahead of schedule, i.e., the team is working at a rate higher than planned. A CPI less than 1.0 means the project (iteration) is over budget, or, in other words, the team earns less than a dollar on each dollar planned. A CPI greater than 1.0 indicates the project (iteration) is under budget, i.e., the team earns more than a dollar compared to each dollar planned. The question asks to determine how much the team members earned on the dollar compared to the plan. Based on the explanation above, the CPI = $60,000 / $70,000 = 0.857. In other words, the team only earned 85.7 cents on the dollar compared to the plan (assuming the prediction is still correct). In the answer, the result is rounded up to 86 cents. Note, one may think that the question is asking to find SPI rather than CPI. The reason for this is that the phrase \"versus the plan\" is ambiguous. The phrase \"versus the plan\", by itself, could pertain to schedule or budget. However, the fact the question is asking about a dollar value implies that the question is asking about CPI rather than SPI. The reference provided, The Agile Practice Guide, uses the same verbiage when referring to CPI and SPI.

The CPI can be determined by dividing the earned value (EV) by the actual cost (AC). The project has earned 40 story points with a value of $100 each which is $4,000.

To close out the project, the project manager gathers the key stakeholders in a room to demonstrate the website before it goes live. What is the project manager seeking to gain from this demonstration?", "explanation" : "The scenario implies the project has entered its final stage, closure, where processes of the Closing Process Group are performed. To adequately complete and close a project, it is necessary for the project manager to obtain 'confirmation' from the customer that the project deliverables have been formally accepted. 'Confirming' the acceptance of the project deliverables during the Close Project or Phase process is different from 'obtaining' formal acceptance of the deliverables during the Validate Scope process. The scenario implies the Validate Scope process has been completed. Therefore, since the project has entered its closure, the project manager is seeking to obtain confirmation that the product scope and deliverables were achieved. By obtaining final acceptance, the project manager is essentially 'confirming' the delivery and formal acceptance of deliverables by the relevant stakeholders. Sometimes, this can be viewed as ticking a checkbox in the checklist of the activities carried out during project closure. It is like asking a question, \"Have the deliverables been accepted earlier in the project as part of the Validate Scope process?\". If the answer is \"Yes\", check the box. This would eventually confirm that the deliverables have already been accepted and that the relevant stakeholders are aware of this fact and agree that the project can now be closed. This is a subtle distinction, and many PMP aspirants struggle with this concept. This question is a good example of what you will see on your real exam – two answer choices arguably being correct answers. The main lesson to take from this question is to be ready during the real exam to face ambiguous questions with answer choices extremely close to one another and always select the answer choice you think is the best of those provided. It will not always be the ideal answer or the answer you would like to see as the correct one, but it should be better than the others. Unfortunately, on the real exam, you will never know the actual correct answer to a particular question. You will only see your final result and will be unable to contact the PMI and argue with them on the correctness of their answers. Therefore, the best advice we can provide you while you are preparing for and taking your exam is to make reasonable assumptions based on all available information in the scenario and, of the choices given, select the ‘best’ answer to the question asked or the answer you believe should be the correct one.

The addition reflects the change, and all project stakeholders should be informed.

Using net present value (NPV) adjusts for inflation to get a more accurate assessment of the true value of future revenues. If the majority of the expense is incurred up front, then even a modest inflation rate of 3% could make the project unprofitable in terms of real value.

It is usually focused on the entire development environment, as opposed to just one aspect of it. Value stream mapping helps teams 'see' processes and process interactions. This technique provides a deeper understanding of where potential roadblocks or constraints exist in a process which allows teams to optimize workflow and eliminate wasteful practices. The single most important goal of using value stream mapping is to identify and eliminate waste.

When iteration planning is complete, the iteration goal is established, and work on the iteration begins, no additional features or changes can be accepted unless the change is so critical that not implementing it may render the currently developed product increment useless/obsolete.

In the scenario, the organization operates in the high-tech industry with new technologies emerging every few months, and the project is expected to have unstable requirements for its entire duration. Adaptive (agile) methodologies are best suited to projects with unstable requirements.

Effective project leaders should leverage engagement and two-way communication to create a positive environment in which adoption and assimilation can occur. Note, based on the wording of the scenario (e.g., after several sprints), one may assume the question describes a software development project, which would typically use adaptive/agile methods.

The work items in the backlog have been estimated and prioritized. After completing several sprints, the team has been asked to re-estimate the remaining items in the backlog. How will the range, accuracy, and confidence of the estimates change?", "explanation" : "The scenario covers the subject of estimating for projects that use an adaptive development approach, as evident by the existence of the backlog and the fact the product is being produced in a series of sprints. Estimates are a quantitative assessment of the likely amount or outcome of a variable, such as project costs, resources, effort, or duration. As the project unfolds, the estimates can change based on the knowledge the team gains about the product and the work involved in developing it. Range, accuracy, and confidence are some of the aspects of estimating. At the start of the project, when little information is available, the range of the estimates will be relatively broad. As the project unfolds and the team becomes more experienced, the range of estimates will become narrower. Accuracy refers to the correctness of an estimate and is linked to the range: the lower the accuracy, the larger the potential range. Therefore, an estimate developed halfway through the project, such as described by the scenario, will be more accurate than the one provided at the start of the project. Confidence is less intuitive than the range and/or accuracy. Generally, confidence increases with experience. Experience working on a previous, similar project can help with the level of confidence. For new and evolving technologies, the confidence in estimates is expected to remain similar or low. Since the scenario describes a project that will use new and evolving technology, the experience the team gains developing the product is \"negated\" but the evolving technology, thus keeping the team from providing a confident estimate. Therefore, under the circumstances provided in the scenario, the team will provide an estimate that will most likely have a narrower range, greater accuracy, but similar (low) confidence.

Each cycle includes the process of determining requirements, analysis, design, development, and testing. The main difference is that in iteration-based agile, each iteration is of the same length (timebox), and each timebox results in a completed feature(s). In flow-based agile, the time it takes to complete a feature is different for each feature. The team pulls features from the backlog based on the team's capacity to start work. The team defines its workflow with columns on a task board (e.g., a Kanban board) and manages the work in progress for each column. According to the scenario, the customer wants the features delivered as the features are completed even if the time between the deliverables will vary from one feature to another.

Successfully leading a project includes understanding the constraints associated with the work.

A typical course of action for an agile project, like the one described in the scenario, is to cut scope when the budget is reduced. However, the customer insists that the same scope is delivered. Quality is another project constraint. And quality costs money. For example, testing the deliverables after it has been developed (or while it's been developed) is part of the prevention costs of quality. Forgoing the testing may save time and, consequently, money.

(Drag and drop the items from right to left.)", "explanation" : "Explanation: The question describes a project in which the project deliverables will be produced using various project management methodologies and practices. When combining different approaches, the project becomes a hybrid. In this question, the answer choices provide a very brief description of each deliverable that contains a defining characteristic of a particular approach. Scrum is an agile methodology that is characterized by timeboxed periods of planning and development during which a product increment is produced. These development periods are referred to as sprints, at the end of which, a potentially releasable product increment with business value is delivered. When using a predictive life cycle (sometimes referred to as traditional waterfall), the project's deliverables and requirements are defined upfront during initial project planning. The project scope is generally fully decomposed into a work breakdown structure (WBS). Note that rolling wave planning may defer some of the decomposition of the project scope, but most of the requirements are still defined upfront, albeit at a higher level. Large projects (or even deliverables) may have dependencies with other related projects and project teams. This situation requires some level of coordination between the teams. Scaling frameworks provide a structure for the various project teams to coordinate their activities. During a Scrum of Scrums (SoS) event, a representative from each scrum team meets on a regular basis to coordinate the activities among the various teams. When using Kanban, work is pulled from a prioritized backlog and processed through various stages of development through to completion. When using Kanban, work in progress (WIP) limits are set for each stage of work (represented by a column on the Kanban board) to expose bottlenecks and improve throughput. Projects are subject to three basic constraints, including time, cost, and scope (often referred to as the triple constraints). When using a predictive framework, the scope is fixed upfront, but the time and cost may vary. Even though time, cost, and scope are all baselined when using a predictive approach, it is highly unlikely that a project will finish exactly on time and budget, but the scope does not typically change. When using agile methods, the project scope is progressively elaborated rather than being defined upfront. A common concern when using agile practices is how to deal with situations in which the project or a deliverable has a fixed deadline and/or budget. Constraint-driven delivery provides a solution to this situation by holding time and/or cost fixed but allowing the scope to vary. When applying constraint-driven delivery, the desired features are captured and prioritized in a project backlog. The project team develops the features with the highest business value first and continues to work their way down the list until they run out of time or budget.

One of the more popular scaling approaches is the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe®). A key principle of SAFe®is the application of systems thinking. Systems thinking entails taking a holistic view of how projects and project parts interact with each other.

To communicate the project's progress with stakeholders, agile projects typically use various information radiators. An information radiator is a visible, physical or digital display that provides information to the rest of the organization enabling up-to-the-minute knowledge sharing without disturbing the team members. Burndown charts are an example of the information radiator. A burnup chart is a graphical representation of the work, usually displayed in story points, completed toward the release of a product. As work is being completed, the chart's curve trends up. A change requested by a stakeholder on an agile project means more story points are added to the product, release, or iteration backlog.

This situation creates special considerations when contracting with a vendor to supply developers. One method of addressing the issue is to use contract terms that include fixed-price increments.

However, the stakeholders are dissatisfied with the quality of the deliverables and the speed of the product releases. An agile coach has been hired to improve the process. After analyzing the situation, the coach suggests several improvements to the team practices.", "explanation" : "Quality of deliverables and speed of delivery are often interconnected. For example, if the quality of the product is low, the team would need to spend time fixing the product, thus delaying the product release. This, in turn, means the organization would deliver less value than what was originally planned for the project. eXtreme Programming (XP) may help mitigate this issue. XP is an agile software development method based on frequent cycles. Some of the XP practices help teams deliver value quickly while maintaining a high quality of the products. In the scenario, the stakeholders are dissatisfied by the quality of the deliverables and the low speed at which the team releases the product. While quality and speed are frequently seen as conflicting project constraints, some of the XP practices may help resolve the conflict or, at least, reduce its intensity, as described below. Continuous integration refers to performing frequent incorporation of work into the whole and then retesting the product/deliverables to determine that the entire product still works as intended. Applying this practice help maintain quality without delaying the speed of delivery. Testing at all levels means employing system-level testing for end-to-end information and unit testing for the building blocks. Teams analyze the system to identify points that require integration, smoke testing, regression testing, etc. Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) is a practice in which the team determines the acceptance criteria of the product/deliverables and then creates the tests that drive writing just enough code and automated tests to meet these criteria. Spikes are short timeboxed intervals within a project during which a team conducts research or prototypes an aspect of a solution to provide its viability or learn some critical technical or functional element. Spikes can be used for estimation, acceptance criteria definition, and understanding the flow of a user's action through the product.

The cost of quality can be broken down into conformance costs, which include prevention and appraisal costs, and non-conformance costs, which include internal and external failures. Typically, the later a defect is found, the more costly it is to correct as more stakeholders and project components can be impacted. Thus, the most expensive category included in the cost of quality would be external failures, also known as escaped defects. Costs associated with escaped defects not only include the cost of remediation but also include things such as loss of reputation, loss of customers, return costs, etc. Therefore, of the available choices, the scrum master most likely focused on the escaped defects as they are to be the costliest. Note, the type of analysis or the tool the scrum master used (such as the five whys, cost-benefit, fishbone diagram, and root cause) is irrelevant to the selection of the correct answer. The idea behind this question is to understand that if the quality is not built into the processes and deliverables, the cost of fixing defects and/or making changes increases almost exponentially as the project progresses.

This ensures a focused and informed approach to resolving the issue. Escalating (A) or revising schedules (C) may be premature without understanding the gap, and lessons learned (D) would be a retrospective activity. The logical first step in quality management is to assess and analyze the gap between the project's deliverables and the quality requirements. By conducting this evaluation, the project manager can determine the extent of the issue (How far is the website’s page load speed from the expected standard?), identify the root cause (Is the issue due to inefficient coding, server response time, or lack of proper optimization?), and decide on corrective actions (Will caching, code optimization, or infrastructure improvements help meet the standard?). This approach aligns with quality assurance principles from the PMBOK® Guide, which emphasize proactive assessment and gap analysis before taking action. First step in quality management: Evaluate deliverables against the defined quality standards. Importance of root cause analysis: Before taking action, understand why the deliverable does not meet expectations.

Here’s why: Risk Identification and Assessment - Before reallocating resources, escalating, or halting production, the project manager must analyze the severity, probability, and impact of non-compliance. This ensures decisions are based on evidence rather than reaction. Updating the Quality Management Plan - The PMBOK® Guide emphasizes that the Quality Management Plan should align with both project objectives and external regulatory requirements. Revising the plan integrates compliance into all processes and avoids future misalignments. Balanced Decision-Making - Since the project already faces schedule and budget constraints, the risk assessment provides a foundation to prioritize regulatory compliance while managing competing constraints. This avoids overreaction (halting production) or blind fixes (reallocating resources without impact analysis).

Thus, traditional waterfall projects usually have only one individual that is accountable for a given task. When using agile, a common approach is to break down the project (or phase) requirements into user stories that can be captured in a product backlog and then prioritized according to business value.

Therefore, when parts of a project are executed with an agile methodology (as is the case with the development phase of this project), the entire team bears collective product ownership. However, when using a waterfall framework (as is the case with the rollout phase), the project manager is more likely to assign tasks to specific individuals, maki", "difficulty" : "medium", "question_images" : null, "explanation_images" : null, "question_metadata" : null, "is_active" : true, "created_at" : "2026-01-29T13:44:13.799729", "updated_at" : "2026-01-29T14:40:06.93891", "answers" : [{"id" : "c8193478-40fd-4ee4-9595-faba45bb74e3", "answer_text" : "The team charter will need to be updated to reflect collective ownership for the completion of project tasks.", "is_correct" : false, "order" : 0}, {"id" : "dcbe4ffc-0166-4697-9166-95ee878686c3", "answer_text" : "The project manager should institute a set of working agreements that worked well on previous waterfall projects.", "is_correct" : false, "order" : 1}, {"id" : "d4f10d23-4d11-4d73-aff4-5a7bbdaec186", "answer_text" : "Each project team member will need to develop their own social contract to support the new framework.", "is_correct" : true, "order" : 2}, {"id" : "65e68e02-d2dd-4e49-9d2d-99a9da7674b6", "answer_text" : "The social contract should reflect a transition from collective to individual ownership for the project tasks.", "is_correct" : false, "order" : 3}]}, {"id" : "94fe9231-4a9c-44cb-aef0-2d99e1aead7a", "question_id" : "RESOURCE-26", "question_type" : "select_one", "certification_name" : "Project Management Professional (PMP)", "knowledge_area_name" : "Project Resource Management", "domain" : "People", "task" : "1.4 Empower team members and stakeholders", "pm_approach" : "Agile / Hybrid", "question_text" : "An agile project will be using new technology.

Risks must also be considered when prioritizing the product backlog. High-risk features should be prioritized over lower risk ones. When there is a risk of failure, as in this case, it is better to fail earlier in the project rather than later when more project resources have been expended. Additionally, the development of high-risk features is more likely to cause rework. Developing high-risk features earlier may reduce the amount of rework required.

A change to the scope baseline requires an approved change request, which was submitted and approved in this case. As with any change request, the change log will need to be updated to reflect the status of the requested change. Since the project scope is increasing, the added scope will need to be reflected in the work breakdown structure (WBS). The lowest level of the WBS is the work package level. The work packages are further decomposed to create a project document called the activity list. The additional project scope will need to be decomposed to include the additional work packages and associated activities, which necessitates a change to the existing activity list. Additionally, with the risk associated with the increase in project scope being identified during initial project planning (perhaps the legislation was pending approval), the risk was included in the risk register, and contingency reserves were assigned. The risk register typically includes risk status, which will need to be updated with the risk being realized. In this scenario, the aforementioned contingency reserves should address the impact on the cost and schedule of the project. Implementing an approved risk response does not require change management. One might argue that the risk response plan could also include changes to the cost baseline, but there is no information presented in the question to suggest this was the case. Therefore, while the cost and schedule baseline may or may not need to be updated, the scope baseline has to be revised. It should also be noted that the correct answers are not intended to be an exhaustive list of project artifacts that will likely need to be updated in this scenario. Additional elements of the project management plan, project schedule, activity attributes, lessons learned register, physical resource assignments, project team assignments, etc. will likely need to be revised as well.

A typical burndown chart tracks the number of story points completed in an iteration or a release.

The goal of the iteration retrospective is to reflect on the work performed and improve the process going forward. Burndown charts can help analyze the team's velocity.

When the velocity is slower than planned, the curves diverge. When the team completes work faster than planned, the slope of the curve of the remaining work is steeper than the planned curve. According to the iteration burndown chart presented in the scenario, right off the start, during the first 2.5 days, the curve of the story points remained to be completed was diverging from the plan, meaning the team's velocity was lower than the one needed to complete the work planned for those days.

The agile coach requests that a team member works with the relevant stakeholders to reduce the WIP.", "explanation" : "Work in progress (WIP) is a measure that indicates the number of work items that are being worked on at any given time. Project teams may use a task board (e.g., a Kanban board) to manage their workflow. When the Kanban board is used, the team would typically define the maximum number of items allowed to be at each column at any given time. These are known as the WIP limits. When the number of items in a column exceeds the WIP limits, a bottleneck occurs, negatively impacting the workflow. In the scenario, one of the Kanban board columns gets overcrowded, and the question asks to identify that column from the choices provided. Understanding the meaning of WIP is required to select the correct answer. WIP is all the work that is going on right now. It includes items being actively worked on right now, work items waiting to be verified or deployed, and all the unfinished tasks that need to be done to deliver value to the customer. The items in the To-Do column of a Kanban board or the items that have not moved from the product backlog to the rest of the process are not considered WIP since work has not yet begun on those items. Completed user stories that have already been deployed at the customer production system are not considered WIP either since they do not require any further work (until defects are found in them, which is typically outside the project boundaries). Of the choices provided, only user stories pending customer feedback are considered WIP.

To overcome this challenge, the team should provide an initial rough estimate of velocity, expressed as a range (what the agile practitioner referred to as \"roughly right\"). As the project progresses and more information becomes available with each subsequent iteration, the level of uncertainty decreases, and the range provided to estimate velocity becomes narrower and more accurate.

A typical burndown chart tracks the number of story points completed in an iteration or a release.

When the velocity is slower than planned, the curves diverge. When the team completes work faster than planned, the slope of the curve of the remaining work is steeper than the planned curve. According to the iteration burndown chart presented in the scenario, right off the start, during the first 2.5 days, the curve of the story points remained to be completed was diverging from the plan, meaning the team's velocity was lower than the one needed to complete the work planned for those days. From the middle of day 3 till the middle of day 5, for whatever reason, the team completed no story points at all. As the iteration progressed, the team's velocity varied and the number of the story points remaining to be completed went down.

However, applying EVM metrics to projects carried out using agile methods can be done similarly and serve as an effective tool to measure team performance. For example, the schedule performance index (SPI) is the number of story points (features) completed divided by the number of the story points (features) planned. The cost performance index (CPI) is the earned value (EV, which is the value of the completed story points or features) divided by the actual costs incurred during the period under measurement. The interpretation of the SPI and CPI values in agile projects are made similarly to the interpretation of those values in traditional projects. For example, an SPI less than 1.0 means the project (or iteration) is behind schedule, or, in other words, the team is working at a rate lower than planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 means the project (iteration) is ahead of schedule, i.e., the team is working at a rate higher than planned. A CPI less than 1.0 means the project (iteration) is over budget, or, in other words, the team earns less than a dollar on each dollar planned. A CPI greater than 1.0 indicates the project (iteration) is under budget, i.e., the team earns more than a dollar compared to each dollar planned. The question asks to determine the SPI.

When agile methodologies are used, deliverables can be deployed iteratively and/or incrementally, which allows an organization to begin realizing business value even while the project is still underway. To answer this question correctly, one needs to understand the difference between response time, cycle time, and lead time. Response time represents the time a work item waits before work begins. Cycle time is measured from the time work begins until it is completed. Lead time is the total time it takes to deliver the work item to the customer.

The cost performance index (CPI) is the earned value (EV, which is the value of the completed story points or features) divided by the actual costs incurred during the period under measurement. The interpretation of the SPI and CPI values in agile projects are made similarly to the interpretation of those values in traditional projects.

By measuring various metrics, such as velocity, throughput, and work in progress (WIP), the team may determine what combination would result in reduced cycle time and implement the new values in the upcoming sprint, thus improving the overall project performance. A formula that can be used to calculate cycle time is: Cycle time = WIP / Throughput. Therefore, if the team can accelerate its throughput - this would be great. However, the easiest way to reduce cycle time is to decrease work in progress (WIP). WIP is the work started but not completed.

Additionally, the question indicates that each of the three project teams is working independently. Both of these factors introduce complications for measuring the overall project's progress.

Under these conditions, properly managing requirements apparently seems difficult, which is the most likely reason the team members raise their concerns. However, whether requirements are known upfront and properly documented or discovered and evolve as the project is carried out, managing requirements is essential. Proper requirement management helps reduce scope creep, rework, customer dissatisfaction, budget and schedule overruns, and may even prevent project failure.

He has just completed the stakeholder classifications and needs to update the project roles.", "explanation" : "Projects are initiated by an entity external to the project, such as a sponsor, program or project management office (PMO), or a portfolio governing body chairperson or authorized representative. The project initiator or sponsor should be at a level that is appropriate to procure funding and commit resources to the project. Therefore, a project sponsor is external to the project, is of high power and high interest, and has an upward direction of influence. Of the available choices, only Todd Young possesses the characteristics of a project sponsor. Note, being external to the project does not necessarily mean being external to the organization. The terms 'internal' vs. 'external' are relative to something. The column \"Internal / External to the Project\" in the table specifies what is being referred to by 'internal' and 'external'. For example, the sponsor is external to the project in that they are not a member of the immediate project team, but they are a stakeholder to the project and internal to the organization. Based on section 1.6 Project Stakeholders of the PMIstandards+TM in the reference provided, one may argue that a sponsor is a project-internal stakeholder. Unfortunately, PMIstandards+TM does not do a great job clarifying that the examples in the \"Internal stakeholders\" and \"External stakeholders\" lists refer to stakeholders as they relate to the performing organization, not project. For example, in the list of stakeholders in section 1.6 Project Stakeholders, the sponsor, resource manager, PMO, team members, etc., could be either external or internal to the project, but they are internal to the performing organization. However, customers, end-users, suppliers, etc., are external to both project and performing organization. Therefore, we strongly believe that a sponsor is an individual who is external to the project, possesses high power and high interest, and has an upward direction of influence. Note, Figure 2-1 Project Boundaries on in section 2. The Standard for Project Management: Initiating Process Group, places the sponsor outside the project boundaries, thus supporting the idea that a sponsor is an entity external to the project. Another consideration that may help support the correct answer is the understanding that one individual who is internal to the performing organization can serve as a project sponsor for multiple projects, keeping this individual external to each one of the projects he/she is sponsoring.", "difficulty" : "medium", "question_images" : null, "explanation_images" : null, "question_metadata" : null, "is_active" : true, "created_at" : "2026-01-07T22:09:00.594493", "updated_at" : "2026-01-07T22:09:00.594493", "answers" : [{"id" : "d9640225-909b-4806-9618-fa792c3c188b", "answer_text" : "John Show", "is_correct" : false, "order" : 0}, {"id" : "e0167611-69e1-42eb-83d7-7fbbe15ed587", "answer_text" : "Todd Young", "is_correct" : true, "order" : 1}, {"id" : "86cfaca2-c832-478b-b97d-d691b8047296", "answer_text" : "Marie Smith", "is_correct" : false, "order" : 2}, {"id" : "66439916-7293-46ce-b6e8-db9cc5cf3644", "answer_text" : "Tonya Stewart", "is_correct" : false, "order" : 3}]}, {"id" : "4dba57e7-ef99-4019-bf04-4b66485fd2f1", "question_id" : "515041", "question_type" : "select_one", "certification_name" : "Project Management Professional (PMP)", "knowledge_area_name" : "Project Stakeholder Management", "domain" : "Process", "task" : "2.4 Engage stakeholders", "pm_approach" : "Predictive", "question_text" : "The project management plan specifies that the work for some of the project deliverables is contracted to vendors.

To be successful, project leaders must enable change to achieve the envisioned future state. The scenario describes a project that will have a significant impact on the organization's employees, which might cause considerable resistance to the project. Change management is a structured approach for transitioning individuals, groups, and organizations from a current state to a desired future state. It is reasonable to assume that relocating an organization's manufacturing center to another geographical location represents a significant change and would be stressful for the affected stakeholders. Effective change management will be a critical factor in overcoming their resistance, mitigating their stress, and realizing the benefits expected from the project. It's important to point out that change management is fundamentally different from change control. Change control is a process where modifications to identified project artifacts must be approved before implementation; change management, on the other hand, enables change to achieve the project's desired benefits. Note, thinking of relocating an organization's manufacturing center as an agile project might be counter-intuitive. Agile projects are typically associated with knowledge work, such as software development. Whether this is the case or not, nothing prevents an organization from using agile methods to undertake other initiatives, for example, relocating organizational assets (such as a manufacturing center described in the scenario) to another geographical location.
